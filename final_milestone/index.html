      <p><b>Summary: Our project was to build an interactive system in Unity for spatial keyframing. Instead of the usual temporal keyframing that is used in animations, we are doing spatial keyframing.</b></p>

<p> Updates: For the 3D models, we built a basic cubeman model, and imorted a fancier person that we rigged using a Unity Animation Rigging package.
  We've also defined the data structures and features needed for the project, and implemented them in a Unity scene. We spent some time getting used to the Unity environment, and then scripting
  in C# and using global variables, and we're happy with the overall setup. We've also played around with changing local positions and rotations in scripts, and have been able to control those character features using scripting variables. Thanks to the Unity inspector, we can manually change those variables while the game is running, and see our
  character move around. For example, we can enter joint angles and translation amounts, and see the character change its pose. We've also accomplished basic user input to control the control_cursor and move
  it around on a 2D plane. next, we will focus on experimenting with a few different interpolation schemes to see which works best, and then link the user-controlled
  control_cursor to the interpolation function so it automatically animates the character as we move the cursor around.

<h2 align="middle">Schedule</h2>

<p>
  <b> Here is our updated work plan:</b>
<br>
- Rest of Week 3: Finish user input and do interpolation. This means allowing the user to set keyframes, and drag the control curser to control the animation.
<br>
- Week 4: Import other models we can use, and be able to control other models. Touch up on the scene, do the presentation and final video to submit.
