          <p>This writeup can be found at: https://cal-cs184-student.github.io/sp22-project-webpages-varunsaran/proj3-2/index.html</p>

        <p>In this project, we implemented models for different materials, such as mirrors, glass, and metals. We started out by doing Part 1, which was Mirror and Glass. Going through the writing of the code was failry straightforward, because the spec was very detailed. We thought our code worked correctly, but later realized the both of our spheres were behaving as only the back sphere should - that is, there was no refraction. We fixed this by carefully going through the code we wrote for task 1.4, which was specific to glass material. Eventually, we found that we were setting the pdf to Schlick's reflection coefficient instead of 1 minus the coefficient. </p>
        <p>We started to do part 2 because we thought it looked the nicest out of the 3 remaining tasks. Parts 2.1 through 2.3 were straightforward, but we did a lot of googling for Part 2.4. We went through a lot of different bugs. One thing we were stuck on for a while was that we were hardcoding alpha and k from the website linked in the spec, instead of using the given ones. We were also using cos instead of cos_theta in some instances, and vice versa. We also had an issue where the shadows of the dragon were purple, which looked very pretty but it was wrong. We went to office hours and that helped us find some of these types of bugs.</p>

        <h2 align="middle">Part 1: Mirror and Glass Materials</h2>
        <p>In this part, we implemented models for mirror and glass materials. We first started by filling in the reflect function. We used this equation: </p>
        <div align="center">
            <table style="width=100%">
                <tr>
                    <td align="middle">
                        <img src="images/eqn.png" width="300px" />
                    </td>
                </tr>

            </table>
        </div>
        <p>Then we did sample_f for mirror materials by reflecting the incoming ray, and returning reflectance / abs_cos_theta(*wi). Then we did refract using Snell's law. If there was not total internal reflection, then we set the values for the returned ray and made sure that the z value was the opposite sign of the z value for the original ray. Finally, we implemented Glass material with Schlick's approximation. Based on Schlick's approximation, we set a pdf and the eta, which helps determine how much we should refract versus reflect.</p>

        <p>As we can see, when the max ray depth is 0, we can only see rays that provide light directly from the source to the camera, which is only the light source. With ray depth 1, there is one bounce, so we can see objects that are directly lit from the light. Since our spheres are refractive and reflective, they require more than one bounce, and are still black. With ray depth of 2, we can see the box reflected in the back sphere, since, the light is able to bounce off the wall, and then hit the sphere itself. However, because there is only one hit on the sphere itself, we can see that the ceiling of the room inside the sphere is still dark. When the ray depth is 3, we can finally see glass material in the front sphere. The light bounces off the sphere, into the walls of the Cornell box, and then back into the sphere, which is 3 bounces. We can also see that the cornell box reflected in the mirror material for the back sphere has a lit ceiling, since rays can hit the sphere first, hit the ceiling, and return to the sphere. After this ray depth, every other image looks pretty similar. They become a little bit lighter due to more bounces of light, but they are generally the same.

        <p>
  The lowest alpha is the most reflective, shiny, and glossy because low alphas represent low roughness. It also has the most noise. As alpha increases,
  the materials roughness increases, and it becomes less reflective and shiny. The noise does decrease, but the surface also becomes more difffuse.
  The more glossy image is a lot more appealing to look at.

  <p>
  Hemisphere sampling is alot more noisy and dark, and it really detracts from the image. Importance sampling still has some noise, but the low-density white specks are
  a lot less noticeable than the high-density black regions from hemisphere sampling.
